# Using Classes & Objects
In the previous guide I covered some basics about what is a class and what is an object. Now we want to take the next step and look into how we use classes.

Classes don't just categorise the type of an object by giving it a name. They allow you to also group methods that can be performed on those objects. We'll use the Array class for all the examples in this guide. You can see the [complete method list for Array][array] on the ruby-doc site.
